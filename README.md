# Library for 74HC595 4 digit 7 segments display by RekoSK
Easy-to-use library to make this display work.

### Features:
    - 3 examples,
    - Printing any number from -999 to 999 on display,
    - Precreated function for printing out any number,
    - Segment toogle (on/off)

### Storage usage:
It's not the most optimized library, but hey, it makes the job done.
Library uses (+-)1200bytes of flash and 14 bytes of SRAM.
I'm planning to make this library more light weight in future...
